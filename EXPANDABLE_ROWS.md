# Expandable Rows in Admin Panel

## âœ¨ Overview

The admin panel now features a modern expandable row system that provides a cleaner, more intuitive user experience. Instead of cluttered action columns, actions are now displayed in expandable sections below each row.

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits

- **Cleaner Table**: No more cluttered actions column taking up valuable space
- **More Space**: Full width available for actual data columns
- **Better UX**: Actions are contextual and appear when needed
- **Modern Design**: Similar to Gmail, Notion, and other modern applications
- **Mobile Friendly**: Works great on smaller screens
- **Less Visual Noise**: Table focuses on data, actions are secondary

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Design

- **Small Arrow**: Subtle expand/collapse indicator that rotates when expanded
- **Smooth Animation**: Row expands/collapses with smooth transition
- **Contextual Actions**: Actions appear right where you need them
- **Clean Layout**: Actions displayed in a nice card layout below the row data

## ðŸ”§ Implementation

### Table Component Updates

The `Table` component now supports expandable rows with these new props:

```typescript
interface TableProps<T> {
  // ... existing props
  expandable?: boolean;
  expandedRows?: string[];
  onRowExpand?: (id: string, expanded: boolean) => void;
  renderExpandedContent?: (row: T) => React.ReactNode;
}
```

### New Components

#### `ExpandedRowActions`

A dedicated component for rendering actions in the expanded section:

- **Grid Layout**: Responsive grid of action buttons
- **Icons**: Each action has a relevant icon
- **Color Coding**: Different colors for different action types
- **Loading States**: Shows loading indicator during operations
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth hover animations

### AdminPage Integration

The `AdminPage` component has been updated to:

- Remove the actions column from the main table
- Add expandable functionality with state management
- Render the `ExpandedRowActions` component in expanded sections

## ðŸš€ Features

## ðŸ“± Responsive Design

The expandable rows work seamlessly across all device sizes:

- **Desktop**: Full table with expandable rows

## ðŸŽ¯ Action Types

The expanded section supports various action types:

- **Primary Actions**: Edit, Delete, Toggle Status
- **Secondary Actions**: Print Invoice, View Address
- **Contextual Actions**: Based on the resource type

## ðŸ”„ State Management

The expandable state is managed at the `AdminPage` level:

```typescript
const [expandedRows, setExpandedRows] = React.useState<string[]>([]);
```

This allows for:

- Multiple rows to be expanded simultaneously
- Persistence of expanded state during filtering/sorting
- Clean state management

## ðŸŽ¨ Styling

The expandable rows use the existing theme system:

- **Consistent Colors**: Uses theme colors for all elements
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions for all animations
- **Dark Mode Support**: Works with both light and dark themes
- **Accessibility**: High contrast and proper focus states

## ðŸ§ª Testing

To test the expandable rows functionality:

1. Navigate to `/admin/test-expandable`
2. Click on any row to expand it
3. Try the different action buttons
4. Test on mobile devices
5. Verify keyboard navigation

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the expandable row system:

- **Bulk Expand**: Expand all rows at once
- **Remember State**: Persist expanded state across sessions
- **Custom Content**: Allow custom content in expanded sections
- **Nested Expansion**: Support for nested expandable content
- **Animation Options**: Configurable animation styles

## ðŸ“‹ Migration Guide

To migrate existing admin pages to use expandable rows:

1. The `AdminPage` component automatically uses expandable rows
2. No changes needed to existing page implementations
3. Actions are automatically moved to the expanded section
4. All existing functionality is preserved

## ðŸŽ‰ Conclusion

The expandable row system provides a modern, clean, and intuitive way to interact with admin data. It improves the user experience while maintaining all existing functionality and adding new capabilities for better data management.
